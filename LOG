This version is amazing

In 109th iteration i got 0.07 and 0.06 for train and validation loss with both accuracy above 90%
Though the file in interest is weights.108 shows . Not sure why weight file is 1 less may be because of counting from 0.

Similar result for 121 iteration.


Key modifications
1. Not loading pretrained weights. Training from scratch
2. Tried to put Learning rate and other SGD param close to or  as per original vgg16

Note that this does not have fc layers of vgg16 (It was removed by origninal author)
