This version is amazing

In 109th iteration i got 0.07 and 0.06 for train and validation loss with both accuracy above 90%
Though the file in interest is weights.108 shows . Not sure why weight file is 1 less may be because of counting from 0.

Similar result for 121 iteration.


Key modifications
1. Not loading pretrained weights. Training from scratch
2. Tried to put Learning rate and other SGD param close to or  as per original vgg16

Note that this does not have fc layers of vgg16 (It was removed by origninal author)



================================

Restarting training because the entire data got deleted on docker :(

Error while running command
Exception: Error when checking model input: expected zeropadding2d_input_1 to have 4 dimensions, but got array with shape (0, 1)

Solution:
Fixed by adding pos and neg folders and giving the correct path --dataset_path
 python cam.py --dataset_path "../../trainsmall/" --train TRAIN

Error
ResourceExhaustedError (see above for traceback): OOM when allocating tensor with shape[32,256,56,56]
         [[Node: Conv2D_6 = Conv2D[T=DT_FLOAT, data_format="NHWC", padding="VALID", strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], use_cudnn_on_gpu=true, _device="/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/gpu:1"](transpose_22, transpose_23)]]

Solution:
Switched to cpu mode for access to higher memory
